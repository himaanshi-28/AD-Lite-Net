Early Detection of Alzheimer’s Disease Using MRI Images Through Deep Learning Models
Duration: January 2024 – May 2024
Institution: NIIT University, Neemrana

Project Overview
This project focuses on the early detection of Alzheimer’s Disease by developing a deep learning model trained on an Alzheimer's 4-class dataset using MRI images. The model leverages supervised learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in detecting the disease at different stages.

Key Features
1. Model Development: Created a deep learning model that classifies Alzheimer’s Disease into four stages with an impressive accuracy of 96.09% on the test dataset.
2. Research Contribution: Implemented novel approaches to enhance the model's performance, currently being compiled into a research publication.
3. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation: Conducted extensive data preprocessing and augmentation to improve model robustness and generalization.
4. Ablation Study: Performed an ablation study by analyzing and comparing various algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Adaptive Learning to identify the most effective model.
5. Tool Exploration: Gained hands-on experience with the Keras and TensorFlow libraries, focusing on model training, testing, and hyperparameter tuning.

Results
1. Training Phase: Achieved 100% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score during the training phase.
2. Testing Phase: The model maintained a strong performance with 96.09% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score during testing.
